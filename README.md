How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
Understanding your audience’s expertise level significantly shapes how you present technical information by determining the depth, complexity, and style of communication.
For tech experts, you can: 
skip the basics
Include technical details- in-depth discussions
Use precise terminology
Expect a fast-paced approach
For regular folks;
You avoid technical jargon
Start with the basics
Use visuals and examples
Ensure clarity over precision- better to slightly oversimplify than to confuse.
